# marketplace-repository-php

This is the official unofficial Marketplace repository script!
All you need to do is throw "repository.php" in a folder, setup your downloads (can be in downloads folder if you wish), then add to Freedeck!

## Example

Let's say you own `yoururl.com`, and want a freedeck repository at `https://yoururl.com/FreedeckRepository`. You'd throw your downloads and repository.php folder in there, then add it to Freedeck like so:
